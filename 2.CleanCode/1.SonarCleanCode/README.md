# Sonar Clean Code

In this chapter we will cover the fundamentals of Clean Code and why it's worthwhile for every software development team to track and improve code quality.

**Clean Code** is code that is:

* Consistent
* Intentional
* Adaptable
* Responsible

And therefore: Maintainable, Reliable, and Secure.

## What is the problem?

Sonar is solving one of the most critical challenges facing the digital economy: **Cost of bad code is Enormous!**

## Clean As You Code

**Clean as you code is the essential approach to achieve a Clean Code state:**

* Developers focus on the quality of code that's added or changed
* Progressively, old issues get corrected without adding new ones
* The quality of the entire codebase improves; Technical debt is controlled

## Sonar Workflow

Implementing SonarLint in your IDE and automating Sonar analysis in your workflow is what we'll cover in the next steps.
